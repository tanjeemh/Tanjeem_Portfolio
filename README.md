# Tanjeem_Portfolio
This repository stores the .html and .css files that together make my own Personal Web Portfolio! The website is mobile AND web-responsive through the use of various JavaScript commands as well. 
This project was created on VSCode IDE and projected onto Google Chrome using the LiveServer extension, providing for a FREE domain.
